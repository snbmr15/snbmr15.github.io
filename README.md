Project One : Flappy Bird

Flappy Bird is a game whereby the player has to maintain flight of the bird without crashing into the obstacles, in this case, the pipes.

Features
- randomised pipe spawning
- running score
- increase speed after a certain score (stretch goals)

Technologies Used
Canvas API
HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript
jQuery

Approach
The game is designed with clear and simple instructions on how to play the game with the most simplest objective which is to not crash into the pipes to have a long standing score. 
Used object concept for the bird and pipes to conveniently attribute the properties.
Added click handlers to incorporate the jump flight of the bird.
Function callbacks are used to create the "stage" of the game.

The game logic is implemented in JavaScript, handling player actions.

Images are generated with Canvas API.

Challenges Faced:
- maintaining distance of pipe spawning when the speed of the pipes are increased after a certain score.
